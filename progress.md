## Progress - Session 1

### Achievements

*   **Project Initialization:** Successfully set up a new Vite project with React and TypeScript.
*   **Dependency Installation:** Installed and configured all necessary dependencies, including `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`, `gsap`, and `tailwindcss`.
*   **Initial Scene Setup:** Created a basic 3D scene with a ground plane, ambient and directional lighting, and camera controls.
*   **Bamboo Forest Instancing:** Implemented a `Bamboo` component and used instancing to render a small forest, following the performance guidelines in the PRD.
*   **Visual Confirmation:** Verified that the initial scene renders correctly in the browser.

### Percentage of Completion

Based on the requirements in `PRD.md`, I estimate that the project is approximately **15% complete**. The foundational elements are in place, but there is still significant work to be done on the core experience, including:

*   Creating distinct forest zones
*   Adding region-appropriate fauna
*   Animating the environment and creatures
*   Implementing zone transitions
*   Refining the visual and audio design

The next steps will focus on building out these core features to bring the experience to life.
